0,3000,hello friends
2500.0,5500.0,rain is liquid water in the form of droplets
5000.0,8000.0,chocolates that have content from it
7500.0,10500.0,atmospheric water vapour and
10000.0,13000.0,and then become heavy enough to fall
12500.0,15500.0,under gravity rain is a major
15000.0,18000.0,component of the water cycle and is responsive
17500.0,20500.0,constable for depositing most of the
20000.0,23000.0,fresh water on the earth it provide
22500.0,25500.0,suitable conditions for many type of
25000.0,28000.0,type of ecosystems as well as water
27500.0,30500.0,water for hydroelectric power plant
30000.0,33000.0,micro irrigation the major cost
32500.0,35500.0,cause of rain production is moisture
35000.0,38000.0,moving along three dimensional zones of
37500.0,40500.0,temperature and moisture contrasts
40000.0,43000.0,known as weather fronts
42500.0,45500.0,it is enough moisture and upon
45000.0,48000.0,motion is present precipitate
47500.0,50500.0,quotation falls from convective clouds
50000.0,53000.0,such as thunder
52500.0,55500.0,thunderclouds which can organise into
55000.0,58000.0,narrow rain back in mountainous area
57500.0,60500.0,heavy precipitation is
60000.0,63000.0,possible where upslope floor is
62500.0,65500.0,maximize within
65000.0,68000.0,update train at elevation
67500.0,70500.0,which causes most of the air to come
70000.0,73000.0,to content and call out as rainfall along
72500.0,75498,along the sides of the mountain thank you
